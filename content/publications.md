We have performed survey-type observations in 1 mm continuum and molecular lines toward dense cores (32 prestellar + 7 protostellar) with an average density of >10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$ in the Taurus molecular clouds using the ALMA-ACA (Atacama Compact Array) stand-alone mode with an angular resolution of $\sim$6\farcs7 ($\sim$940 au). The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the innermost part of dense cores toward understanding the initial condition of star formation. Contributions from protostellar disks dominate the continuum emission in most of the observed protostellar cores. For the prestellar cores, we have successfully confirmed continuum emission from dense gas with a density of $\gtrsim$(0.5--1) $\times$ 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$ toward approximately one-third of the targets. The detection rate is significantly higher than that of the previous surveys toward starless cores using the ALMA Main array.
The statistical counting method tells us that the lifetime of the condensation approaches the free-fall time as the density increase.
Among the prestellar cores, at least two targets have promising internal substructures in continuum emission with the size scale of $\sim$1000 au if we consider the molecular line (C$^{18}$O and N$_2$D$^{+}$) distributions.
This result suggests that small scale fragmentation/coalescence processes within a $\lesssim$0.1 pc prestellar core can occur to determine the final core mass before the dynamical collapse.

The first hydrostatic core, the first quasi-hydrostatic object formed during the star formation process, is still the observational missing link between the prestellar and protostellar phases, mainly due to its short lifetime. Although we have not established a clear method to identify this rare object, recent theoretical studies predict that the first core has millimeter continuum emission and low-velocity outflow with a wide opening angle. An extensive continuum/outflow survey toward a large number of "starless" cores in nearby star-forming regions works as a pathfinder.
We observed 32 prestellar cores in Taurus with an average density of $\gtrsim$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$ in 1.3 mm continuum and molecular lines using the ALMA-ACA stand-alone mode. Among the targets, L1535-NE/MC35 has blueshifted/redshifted wings in the $^{12}$CO (2--1) line, indicating that there is deeply embedded object driving molecular outflow. The observed velocities and sizes of the possible outflow lobes are 2--4 km s$^{-1}$, and $\sim$ 2 $\times$ 10$^3$ au, respectively, and the dynamical time is calculated to be $\sim$10$^3$ yr. In addition to this, the core is one of the strongest N$^2$D$^+$ (3--2) emitter in our sample. 
All the observed signatures do not conflict with any of the theoretical predictions about the first hydrostatic core so far, 
and thus L1535-NE/MC35 can be a unique candidate of the first core in the Taurus molecular cloud.
